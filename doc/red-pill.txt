## Red Pill Mode

The Hildon Application Manager has a special hidden mode that makes it
more power user friendly and gives you access to features that are not
yet considered to be ready for everybody. This mode used to be an
easter egg, but we feel we have to give it away officially now since
it is so useful.

### Activation

Go to "Tools > Application catalogue", click "New", enter "matrix"
into the "Web Address" field, click "Cancel". Choosing the red pill
will activate the red pill mode, obviously, and chosing the blue one
will deactivate it.

### Settings

After activating the red pill mode, the following additional settings
are available in "Tools > Settings".

 - *Clean apt cache*

   If activated, the equivalent of "apt-get clean" is performed after
   every install or update.  (This is the behavior for blue-pill
   mode.)

 - *Assume net connection*

   This will not ask for an active IAP before downloading.  This is
   useful if you have a network connection, but the 770 connectivity
   APIs are not available or don't know about it.

 - *Break locks*

   This will break needed locks instead of failing.  This is done by
   default in blue pill mode so that users don't lock themselves out
   when a crash leaves a stale lock behind.

 - *Show dependencies*

   This adds another tab to the details dialog with some dependencies
   from the package.

 - *Show all packages*

   This will not filter out packages that are not in the "user"
   section.  It will also allow installing packages from any section.

 - *Show magic system package*

   This will include the "magic:sys" package in the list of packages.
   Updating that package will do something similar to "apt-get
   upgrade".  It is not yet fully defined what it will do exactly.
   This feature might become available in blue-pill mode at one point.

 - *Include package details in log*

   When this setting is active, opening a package details dialog will
   dump its content into the Log so that you more easily save it.
   This should be useful when reporting complicated dependency issues.

   This setting can only be changed in red-pill mode, but it's effect
   stays active also in blue-pill mode.
