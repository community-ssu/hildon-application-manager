## Scripting the Hildon Application Manager

The Application Manager can be scripted in a limited way.  This
ability is used to implement the "Single Click" install feature as
used on the maemo Application Catalogue, when installing applications
from a memory card, and also to control what happens when a backup is
restored that contains a list of applications.  Hopefully new uses can
be found.

The scriptability is limited mainly for two reasons: to keep the
implementation simple and to make the interaction with the user
simple.  The user should have a good enough idea of what the script is
going to do to his/her system.  There is no real security however;
ultimately, you need to trust the scripts that you execute, just as
you need to trust the packages that you install.

### Basic syntax

A installation script is made up of X-expressions.  X-expressions are
a subset of XML that has been inspired by Lisp's S-expressions.  A
X-expression is either a list or a text; both lists and tags have
symbolic tags.

A text X-expression is written like this:

    <tag>text</tag>

where TAG is the tag of the X-expression and TEXT is the text.

A list X-expression is written like this:

    <tag>elt1 elt2 ...</tag>

where TAG is the tag of the X-expression and ELT1, ELT2, etc are the
elements of the list.  The elements are all X-expressions themselves,
of course.  There can be arbitrary whitespace around the elements.

For example, the following is a "foo" list with two "bar" text
elements.

    <foo>
     <bar>first text</bar>
     <bar>second text</bar>
    </foo>

You can only put whitespace around list elements.  Thus, the following
is not a legal X-expression, although it is legal XML:

    <foo>
     no text here
     <bar>but this is ok</bar>
     and not here either
    </foo>

Attributes are ignored.  All text must be encoded in UTF-8.

### Catalogues

One important element in .install scripts are catalogue descriptions.
Such a catalogue description is a list X-expression with the tag
"catalogue" and a number of children that specify the properties of
the catalogue.  For example, the following is the description of a
typical catalogue:

    <catalogue>
     <name>maemo bora extras</name>
     <uri>http://repository.maemo.org/extras</uri>
     <dist>bora</dist>
     <components>free non-free</components>
    </catalogue>

The following properties can be used:

  - `name`

  The name of the catalogue, as displayed to the user in the
  "Catalogues" dialog.  This X-expression can be a text, in which case
  it is used directly for display.  It can also be a list of texts, in
  which case the text to display is selected based in the current
  language.  If there is a element whose tag matches the current
  language code, it is used.  If not, the first element is used.

  Thus, the following will provide a localized name for the "es\_ES"
  language code, and will use the "en\_GB" variant otherwise:

        <name>
         <en_GB>Foo Catalogue</en_GB>
         <es_ES>Repositorio Foo</es_ES>
        </name>

  If you don't specify a name, the empty string will be used.

  - `uri`, `dist`, `components`

  The texts to use when forming the "deb" line for sources.list.  The
  "dist" property can be a text, or it can be a list that contains the
  single element <automatic/>.  In that case, the symbolic
  distribution name of the appropriate maemo release is used when
  forming the "deb" line.

  - `tag`, `version`

  These two properties identify a catalogue and the version of its
  description.  They are used when adding or updating catalogues from
  installation scripts.

  Tags should be globally unique, so it is recommended to form them
  from a domain name, in reverse.  For example, a catalogue hosted on
  maemo.org might use

        <tag>org.maemo.repository.extras.bora</tag>

  If the version property is omitted, it is treated as zero.

The following two properties are filtered out when a catalogue
description appears in a installation script, but they are used when
storing catalogues.

  - `essential`

  When present, marks the catalogue as essential.  Essential
  catalogues can not be removed or edited by the user.

  - `disabled`

  When present, marks the catalogue as disabled.  Disabled catalogues
  are remembered but are not used by the Application Manager.

The Application Manager allows the user to add new catalogues and to
edit existing catalogues.

When the user adds a new catalogue, that catalogue will have no tag
and no version, and will not use a <automatic/> distribution.  It will
have a single text as name.

When the user changes the name of a catalogue, the element in its
description is changed that provided the name in the first place.  The
other elements are not changed.

When showing a dialog to the user that has a <automatic/>
distribution, the appropriate symbolic name is substituted in the
display.  When the user changes the distribution, the new text will be
used instead of <automatic/>, thus making the catalogue non-automatic.

The tag and version of a catalogue are removed when the user changes
the catalogue.

### Catalogue filters


### Instructions

An installation script is a simple sequence of instructions, with no
loops or other control structures.

The whole script is represented by a single "install-instructions"
list X-expression that has the instructions as its elements.

The following instructions can be used:

  - `install-packages`

        <install-packages>
         <pkg>package1</pkg>
         ...
        <install-packages>

  Install the listed packages, one after the other.

  - `update-catalogues`

        <update-catalogues>
         <catalogue>
          ...
         </catalogue>
         ...
        </update-catalogues>

  Adds the listed catalogues to the set of active catalogues, if
  needed.  This instruction should be used as a preparation for a
  `install-packages` instruction to make sure that the needed
  repositories are configured.

  If a listed catalogue has no tag property, it is always added (so
  you should give each of the listed catalogues a tag).

  Otherwise, if there is no configured catalogue with the given tag,
  the listed catalogue is added.  If there is a configured catalogue
  with the given tag, the listed catalogue is added when its version
  is higher than the version of the configured catalogue.  The
  configured catalogue is removed in this case.

  If there is a configured catalogue with a higher or equal version,
  it is not updated.  But if it is disabled, it is enabled.

  - `add-catalogues`

        <add-catalogues>
         <catalogue>
          ...
         </catalogue>
         ...
        </add-catalogues>

  Adds the listed catalogues to the set of active catalogues.  This
  instruction should be used if the purpose of the script is to add
  more catalogues to the Application Manager that the user can later
  browse.  If a configured catalogue already exists with a tag of a
  listed catalogue, it is removed, regardless of version.

  - `with-temporary-catalogues`

        <with-temporary-catalogues>
         instruction
         ...
        </with-temporary-catalogues>

  Execute the subordinate instructions while switched to a temporary
  catalogue state.  When entering this state, the old list of
  catalogues is saved, and then the list of catalogues is set to be
  empty.  When leaving the temporary catalogue state, the old list of
  catalogues is restored.  You can not nest
  `with-temporary-catalogues` instructions.

The Application Manager will interact with the user as appropriate
when carrying out these instructions.

When executing a `<update-catalogues>` or `<add-catalogues>`
instruction, the listed catalogues are first filtered according to
`<filter-dist>`.  If after filtering the remaining list of catalogues
is empty, the installation script is declared incompatible with the
current operating system and processing stops.

When adding or updating a catalogue for the non-temporary state, the
user is asked to confirm this for each change.  Adding catalogues to
the temporary state is done silently.  If s/he declines any of the
changes all changes that have so far been made during this instruction
will be undone and the processing of the installation script stops.
Otherwise, the package cache will be refreshed at the end of the
instruction and execution of the script continues even when this
fails.  For a `add-catalogues` instruction, the cache refreshing has
to be confirmed by the user, but it is done without asking for the
`update-catalogues` instruction.

For a `install-packages` instruction, the user is asked to confirm the
installation of the packages, and can select from a list.  Packages
that are listed in the instruction but are already installed and
uptodate are omitted from the list.  If the user cancels the
confirmation, processing of the script stops.  Otherwise, the selected
packages are installed one after the other.  If an installation fails,
the script stops.

If the installation script isn't executed from a memory card or when
restoring the list of applications, you can only specify one package
in a `<install-packages>` instruction.  The Application Manager will
ignore the rest (because we don't want people to put more than one
package behind a Single-Click install link).  If you want to test a
multi-package installation script, put the Application Manager into
red-pill mode; then it will use the multi-package confirmation dialog
when there is more than one package to install.

### Example

The following X-expression is a installation script to install the
maemofoo package from the Foobar repository.

    <install-instructions>
     <update-catalogues>
      <catalogue>
       <tag>com.foobar.repository.automatic</tag>
       <version>0</version>
       <name>
        <en_GB>Foobar Catalogue</en_GB>
        <de_DE>Foobar Katalog</de_DE>
       </name>
       <uri>http://example.com/</uri>
       <dist><automatic/></dist>
       <components>main</components>
      </catalogue>
     </update-catalogues>
     <install-packages>
      <pkg>maemofoo</pkg>
     </install-packages>
    <install-instructions>

Here is another, slightly more involved example.  This one can be used
on a memory card.  It will offer to install the listed packages and
will use a repository on the memory card for that.  Repositories for
"bora" and "mistral" are supplied, and they are located relative to
the installation script.  Afterwards, it will offer to add an
automatic repository that might be used to deliver updates.

    <install-instructions>
     <with-temporary-catalogues>
      <add-catalogues>
       <if><and><dist>bora</dist>
                <arch>armel</arch>
           </and>
        <catalogue>
         <filter-dist>bora</filter-dist>
         <uri><file-relative>.repository/bora</file-relative></uri>
        </catalogue>
       </if>
       <catalogue>
        <filter-dist>mistral</filter-dist>
        <uri><file-relative>.repository/mistral</file-relative></uri>
       </catalogue>
      </add-catalogues>
      <install-packages>
       <pkg>frozen-bubble</pkg>
       <pkg>crazy-parking</pkg>
      </install-packages>
     </with-temporary-repositories>
     <add-catalogues>
      <catalogue>
       <name>
        <en_GB>Foobar Games</en_GB>
        <de_DE>Foobar Spiele</de_DE>
       </name>
       <uri>http://foobar.com/</uri>
       <dist><automatic/></dist>
       <components>main</components>
      </catalogue>
     </add-catalogues>      
    <install-instructions>

### Compatibility with IT OS 2007.

The old GKeyFile format used by IT OS 2007 is still supported.  You
can embed a X-expression in it as comments like so:

    # <install-instructions>
    #  ...
    # </install-instructions>

    [install]
    repo_deb_3=deb http://foobar.com/ bora main
    package=maemofoo

    [install-instructions]
    xexp = <install-instructions>...</install-instructions>
    
If the Hildon Application Manager encounters such a file with an
embedded X-expression, it will use that and ignore the rest.  If there
is no X-expression, it will transform the GKeyFile according to the
following rules.
