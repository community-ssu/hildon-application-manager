## Scripting the Hildon Application Manager

The Application Manager can be scripted in a limited way.  This
ability is used to implement the "Single Click" install feature as
used on the maemo Application Catalogue, when installing applications
from a memory card, and also to control what happens when a backup is
restored that contains a list of applications.  Hopefully new uses can
be found.

The scriptability is limited mainly for two reasons: to keep the
implementation simple and to make the interaction with user simple.
The user should have a good enough idea of what the script is going to
do to his/her system.  There is no real security however; ultimately,
you need to trust the scripts that you execute, just as you need to
trust the packages that you install.
