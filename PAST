Completed features of the Hildon Application Manager
====================================================

See FUTURE for planned features.

* Show repository that a package is going to be installed from
  [victor, vjaquez-show-repo]

The "Details" dialog should be extended somehow to show the
repositories / catalogues that a package is going to be installed
from.

* Remove UI from maemo-select-menu-location [mvo, mvo-remove-menu-location].

It's annoying.

* Repairing broken packages [mario]

If a visible package is in a broken state, it should also be shown in
the "Check for Updates" view and updating it should try to unbreak the
package.

Just using mark_for_install might be good enough for unbreaking a
package.

Right now, packages that need to be reinstalled are shown in the
"Installable applications" view.  This shouldn't be done anymore.

Open issue: what about broken invisible packages?  Their brokenness
could be charged to the visible parents, but that will charge a broken
libgtk, say, on all visible packages.

* Ignoring packages that violate domain boundaries [mvo]

The Application manager remembers for each package the 'domain' where
it was installed from originally.  Updates to a package that come from
another domain are rejected.

Right now, the Application manager fails installations that have one
or more of these domain violations.  Instead, it should just ignore
packages from a wrong domain.  This will get rid of the most hard core
error message of the AM.

There is already a hook into libapt-pkg to deal with the domain
system.  This hook might be good enough, it might have to be changed.
Some thoughts should be spent on whether to move the whole domain
concept into libapt-pkg.  Maybe writing a custom DepCache::Policy is
the way to go.

* Speeding up preparation of large operations [mvo]

Computing an update (calling mark_install in the apt-worker, etc) used
to be quick enough, but now it can be quite slow since we have large
OS updates.  This needs to be sped up.

When performing an installation, the frontend asks the backend to
compute the same update three times or so.  Either the frontend needs
to ask less often or the backend should keep the last operation in the
cache.

* Automatic recovery after an interrupted operation [mvo]

When a package management operation is interrupted abruptly, the
system might still be able to recover by trying to complete the update
on the next boot.

To acomplish this, the apt-worker is run in a new "rescue" mode on
every boot, as early as possible.

The rescue mode will determine whether any repairs are needed, and if
so, will attempt them.  Determining whether any repairs are needed
must be fast.

Steps:

- Move flash-and-reboot functionality into apt-worker so that it is
  available during repairs.

- Have the apt-worker write a journal for each INSTALL_PACKAGE
  operation.  The journal entry should contain the package name and
  the location with the packages.

- Add the "rescue" command line command which will look at the
  journal.  If the journal is non-empty, try to finish it.

Finishing the journal means first running "dpkg --configure -a",
ignoring any errors, and then redoing the installation described in
the journal.  Then, "dpkg --configure -a --force-all" is run, for good
measure.

If any packages would need to be downloaded, the repair is not done.

If the required, the device is rebooted, or flash-and-reboot is run at
the end, or booting is allowed to continue.

UI of this to be decided.


* Pushing of messages into the update notifier plugin [felipe]

Product management wants to be able to notify the user about
significant new applications that are available for theri internet
tablets.  They want to use the existing update notifier statusbar
plugin for that.

The update-notifier plugin should be able to watch a given URI and
present information from this URL via the statusbar icon.  When the
contents of the resource behind the URI has changed, the icon should
start blinking; when the user taps it, the blinking should stop and a
menu with information from the resource should open; when the user
selects an action from the menu, the icon should disappear.

The original update notification functionality of the statusbar plugin
should have priority: the resource watching functionality should only
control the icon when the update notification functionality would hide
the icon.

The URI should be checked at the same time as the checking for
updates.

Final details about the UI and the content of the watched resource are
upcoming.  The menu should have two action items in it: "Tell me
more", which opens the web browser with a given URI, and "No thanks",
which does nothing else than hide the icon.

To get started, the content of the resource should be assumed to be a
xexp of the form:

  <info>
   <text>Blah, blah</text>
   <uri>http://www.example.com/</uri>
  </info>

This should yield a menu like this:

  Blah, blah                <- insensitive
  -----------
  Show me more              <- open browser on http://www.example.com
  No, thanks.               <- hides icon

It is important that checking the URI does not block the process.  If
needed, a separate process should be spawned (no threads, please).

* Automatic checking for updates in the background

- APTCMD_UPDATE_PACKAGE_CACHE is renamed to APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES and
  made cancellable at every point, not just during downloading.  Also,
  it should not report errors at the end of the operation but store
  them away for later retrieval.  It should also collect the
  information necessary for the notification plugin (number of
  available updates, classified into "OS", "Nokia", and "Other") and
  store it away.

- The apt-worker should be able to be invoked from the command-line to
  perform the APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES operation.  When invoked in this
  way, the operation should be cancellable (using SIGINT, say).  Also,
  it should refuse to run when the apt-worker is already running as
  the backend for the AM.

- When the apt-worker starts in its usual role as the backend for the
  Application Manager, it should cancel already running instances of
  itself that have been started from the command line.

- The Application Manager should have the new "Update All" button in
  the "Check for Updates" view.

- There is a new component: the notification statusbar plugin.  The
  notification plugin runs always and is in one of three different
  states: invisible/visible/blinking.

- The notification plugin invokes the apt-worker in comand-line mode
  to perform APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES 'occasionally'.  Such a operation is
  attempted when the following conditions are all true:

  - The last APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES has stopped (successfully or not,
    interrupted or not) 24 hours or more ago.

  - There is a active WLAN connection (no Bluetooth).

  When the APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES can not be performed because the
  apt-worker is already running as the backend for the Application
  Manager, the notification plugin should send a message to the AM
  that requests it to do the operation instead.

- When the Application Manager receives such a request, it will
  perform it as early as possible.  It is possible to do it when the
  AM has been idle for at least one minute.  Idle means: no
  interaction flow is active.

- The state changes of the plugin are as follows:

  - when the user taps it (to open the menu), it stops blinking.

  - when a APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES initiated by the plugin itself was
    sucessful and updates are available and the plugin was invisible
    before, it starts blinking.

  - when the "Check for updates" view in the Application Manager is
    opened, or when the user invokes the Application Manager from the
    plugin menu and the "Check for Updates" view is already open, the
    plugin becomes invisible.

- The notification plugin should store its visibility state
  permanently across reboots.

- The notification plugin should be notified by apt-worker whenever
  the information for it changes, and the plugin should then read that
  information and reconstruct its menu.
