New features for the Hildon Application Manager
===============================================

* Automatic checking for updates in the background

- APTCMD_UPDATE_PACKAGE_CACHE is renamed to APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES and
  made cancellable at every point, not just during downloading.  Also,
  it should not report errors at the end of the operation but store
  them away for later retrieval.  It should also collect the
  information necessary for the notification plugin (number of
  available updates, classified into "OS", "Nokia", and "Other") and
  store it away.

- The apt-worker should be able to be invoked from the command-line to
  perform the APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES operation.  When invoked in this
  way, the operation should be cancellable (using SIGINT, say).  Also,
  it should refuse to run when the apt-worker is already running as
  the backend for the AM.

- When the apt-worker starts in its usual role as the backend for the
  Application Manager, it should cancel already running instances of
  itself that have been started from the command line.

- The Application Manager should have the new "Update All" button in
  the "Check for Updates" view.

- There is a new component: the notification statusbar plugin.  The
  notification plugin runs always and is in one of three different
  states: invisible/visible/blinking.

- The notification plugin invokes the apt-worker in comand-line mode
  to perform APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES 'occasionally'.  Such a operation is
  attempted when the following conditions are all true:

  - The last APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES has stopped (successfully or not,
    interrupted or not) 24 hours or more ago.

  - There is a active WLAN connection (no Bluetooth).

  When the APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES can not be performed because the
  apt-worker is already running as the backend for the Application
  Manager, the notification plugin should send a message to the AM
  that requests it to do the operation instead.

- When the Application Manager receives such a request, it will
  perform it as early as possible.  It is possible to do it when the
  AM has been idle for at least one minute.  Idle means: no
  interaction flow is active.

- The state changes of the plugin are as follows:

  - when the user taps it (to open the menu), it stops blinking.

  - when a APTCMD_CHECK_UPDATES initiated by the plugin itself was
    sucessful and updates are available and the plugin was invisible
    before, it starts blinking.

  - when the "Check for updates" view in the Application Manager is
    opened, or when the user invokes the Application Manager from the
    plugin menu and the "Check for Updates" view is already open, the
    plugin becomes invisible.

- The notification plugin should store its visibility state
  permanently across reboots.

- The notification plugin should be notified by apt-worker whenever
  the information for it changes, and the plugin should then read that
  information and reconstruct its menu.
