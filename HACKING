Getting started with hacking on the Application Manager
-------------------------------------------------------

You need to install the "fakeroot" package in your Scratchbox in order
to run the Application Manager there.  (It uses fakeroot in SB and
sudo on the device.)

You probably also want to set

    assume-connection 1

in ~/.osso/hildon-application-manager.  Otherwise it will try to use
the Connectivity APIs that are not present.  Run the AM once and then
edit the file.

When building the AM, it will also create a
hildon-application-manager.run executable.  This executable doesn't
use maemo-launcher and is thus easier to use for debugging.

If you have changed apt-worker.bin and you want to test it without
installing it, you can give its location as a parameter to
hildon-application-manager.

I usually run it like this from .../src/ in Scratchbox:

    run-standalone.sh ./hildon-application-manager.run ./apt-worker.bin

Releases
........

Version numbers are bumped post-release: configure.ac always contains
the version that is going to be released next and debian/changelog
contains a prepared entry for the next release with a "~unreleased"
suffix.  You can use suffixes of the form "~unreleasedN", if you have
a use for them.

When making the release, remove the "~unreleased" suffix and update
the time line.  Make a tag in svn.  Bump the version in configure.ac
and create a new debian/changelog (with the "~unreleased" suffix) in
debian/changelog and commit these changes to trunk.
