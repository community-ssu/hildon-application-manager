The usual way to install the hildon-application-manager is to build a
.deb package and install that but you can also install from source.

Hit-and-run instructions:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

Via .deb:

  $ ./configure
  $ make deb
  # dpkg --install hildon-application-manager_<version>_<arch>.deb

After checking out the sources from Subversion you need to run
./autogen.sh before the steps above.
